Hello, I'm Zachary Tieu, Technical Designer and Programmer, graduating from USC this year! I'm passionate about designing and implementing mechanics that make the stories within and born from games sing.\

  Favorite Game Genre: Turn-Based Strategy.\
  Favorite Game: Harebrained Studioâ€™s Shadowrun. A great introduction to the tabletop setting and the alternative options various builds enable make it a shining example of a CRPG/Tactical RPG, only augmented by the great mods available.
