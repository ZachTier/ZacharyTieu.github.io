Hello, I'm Zachary Tieu, Technical Designer and Programmer, a 2025 USC Graduate with a degree in Computer Sceience Games! I'm passionate about designing and implementing mechanics that make the stories within and born from games sing.

  Favorite Game Genre: Turn-Based Strategy.\
  Favorite Game(s): 
    * Single-player Game: Harebrained Studioâ€™s Shadowrun. A great introduction to the tabletop setting and the alternative options various builds enable make it a shining example of a CRPG, where builds serve more than gameplay purposes and instead are storytelling mechanics in of themselves. Alongside a well-paced, intriguing story and a host of memorable companions (at least, starting with the second and third game in the series), it's my absolute #1 pick for games I'd recommend to others. Things only get better with the mods, shout out to Cirion's additions to the game!
    * Multiplayer Game: Odyssey Interactive's Omega Strikers. A vibrant setting inhabited by equally outlandish characters (lizard war criminal? Giant soondubu hamster? AI companion catgirl? Sure, why not!) that altogether just form a visually rich, endearing, and flat-out fun to look at game. Gameplay-wise, it mixes fast-paced sports action with the MOBA genre into its own unique identity, leveraging the fast paced moment to moment intensity of air hockey and the hero shooter/MOBA-style of character design to make a game that really never gives the player a moment to breathe in the best way possible. Add to that the awakening system of powerups to give depth and progression as each match progresses, and you have my personal pick for competitive games.
    * Game to Study: Pokemon. It's a fascinatingly deep game, with a rich history only afforded to a game series of Pokemon's size and scope. As a case study for internal balance and develping metas, it truly is in a league of its own. TCG's come close in the number of options available to players, but due to Pokemon's tiered system of competitive viability (various tiers of play based on how often pokemon are used at the highest levels) there's so many various ecosystems in play at a time that the game truly just towers above everything else.
