What it is:\
A horror puzzle game that mixes turn-based and real-time elements for a unique flavor. Escape a supernatural haunted manor with your dexterity and wits, evading enemies that might or might not decide they want to play by same rules that you do...

My Responsibilities:
* Pitched and led the creation of a hybrid real-time and turn-based horror puzzle game, developing the entire experience solo in Unity while coordinating a small interdisciplinary team for art and feedback. Drove all core systems programming, puzzle logic, and interaction design, bringing a tightly scoped, atmospheric experience to life from the ground up.
* Crafted the game’s level and puzzle design to support strategic decision-making under tension, using environmental storytelling and notes left by a previous character to build narrative intrigue without dialogue. Also guided the game's visual and thematic direction, collaborating with artists to shape a cohesive tone and horror aesthetic.
* Led iterative playtesting and usability testing, using player feedback to improve puzzle clarity, streamline interactions, and enhance onboarding. Managed production tasks including sprint planning, milestone tracking, and documentation, ensuring timely progress and team alignment within a tight academic schedule—while maintaining full responsibility for the game’s core development.
