What it is:\
A turn-based tactical role-playing game with an emphasis on using dialogue and empathy to resolve challenges instead of direct combat. Currently in development in collaboration with other students from the University of Southern California, Otis College of Art and Design, and Berklee College of Music!

What I did:
* As the team's AI programmer, lead the designing and implementing of 10+ enemy AI types
* Implemented abilities for the above enemy type, ranging from AOE fireblasts to dashes
* Co-ordinated with a team of other designers and programmers to test, debug, and perfect the AI for our game

What I learnt:\
Developing games in larger teams with a larger timeframe is a very different scale compared to tackling challenges in smaller teams. Communication is always key, but co-ordinating to avoid blockers, keeping track of where you stand in the development pipeline, and knowing where to find things and how to communicate problems and solutions are skills that can't be practiced without these big team projects.
