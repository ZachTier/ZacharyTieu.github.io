What it is:\
A turn-based tactical role-playing game with an emphasis on using dialogue and empathy to resolve challenges instead of direct combat. Currently wrapping up post-prouction: the meat of the game is in place, fully developed and properly polished, with just a few tweaks needed before the grand release in July of 2025! The game also won the 2025 USC Games Expo Audience Choice Award for Experimental Design.

My responsibilities:
* Spearheaded the design and implementation of 10+ unique enemy types, collaborating closely with the design team to ensure each AI’s behavior cycle and ability set was both technically feasible and balanced for gameplay. Took point on adapting enemy AI to work without traditional navigation or character systems, coordinating with fellow engineers to develop custom solutions. Faced with the absence of a standard SRPG grid or built-in navigation tools, I architected a hybrid pathfinding system that combined navmesh traversal, raycasting, and tactical heuristics—leveraging enemy/ally positioning and terrain analysis to inform movement and attack decisions. This system enabled dynamic, context-aware AI behavior that supported our game’s strategic depth while working within the constraints of our custom engine.
* Designed and implemented a wide range of enemy abilities, including area-of-effect attacks, buffs, debuffs, and movement-based skills, each tailored to specific enemy archetypes and combat roles. Worked cross-functionally with the design team to translate high-level ability concepts into responsive, in-game mechanics that felt fair, engaging, and strategically meaningful. and itereated on a modular, extensible ability framework that supported status effect stacking, conditional triggers, and spatial targeting logic—all integrated with our custom combat and AI systems to make the abilities functional and readable within our game's framework.
* Worked closely with designers to shape combat encounters by providing technical guidance on enemy behavior, positioning, and ability synergy. Ensured that enemy group compositions and placements complemented their AI roles and ability kits, creating encounters that felt intentional, challenging, and varied. Advised on the feasibility of complex ability interactions, helping refine designs to fit within engine limitations while maintaining gameplay impact. This included analyzing how enemies' spatial behavior—such as flanking, chokepoint denial, or zone control—interacted with abilities like AOE attacks, movement skills, buffs, and debuffs.

Core Challenges and Thought Processes:
* Core challenges in my main task of AI design: positioning nd vision vision timing.
  * Positioning:
    * Without any form of a grid/node system that'd allow for traditional pathfinding algorithms like A star to function, this was my biggest challenge overall. Both ranged and melee units presented unique challenges. The default pathfinding for melee units was simple: move to nearest enemy and hit them, with slight variations. Soldiers, as an example, would move towards the nearest enemy CLUSTERS, as their goal was to use their attack of opprotunity ability to tie up multiple enemies. The biggest issue though was the unused cover system, where out of range melee units would seek LOS obscuring terrain in order to mitigate damage on the approach. Given the lack of a grid, categorizing and iterating over a set of viable node options wasn't viable. Even determining what WAS cover was its own difficulty, as a waist-high stump might be impassable on the Navmesh, but clearly wouldn't work as cover. Ultimately, the solution I devised was using a Cover script to label that the level designers intended to be viable cover. Enemies seeking cover would first determine which points of cover were closer to the enemy than their own initial position, then pick points along those objects' bounding boxes, finding a spot within movement range and displaced enough that their body would be fully obscured. From there, ranking each of these points by distance from the target enemy would guide them
    * Ranged enemies had somewhat of the opposite system. Given LOS, they were even simpler than melee units, simply walking forward and shooting once in range, and standing behind cover wasn't a priority since there was no half/full cover system. Instead, the challenge became pathing around to ensure LOS. Once more, without any grid system, simply iterating over spaces in range wasn't an option. Instead, the solution settled upon was checking in a circle around the target with a radius based on the unit's attack range, since the ideal position for the AI would be at maximum ranged attack range with LOS. From there, rank the valid positions based on proximity to enemies (don't want them walking into a cluster of player units by accident, of course) and distance from the unit's starting location, giving the ranaged enemies the ability to intelligently decide on places to move towards if they didn't have range or LOS on their target.
  * Vision:
    * Raycasting obviously was the solution here, but it took some iterations to adjust for exactly how we wanted them. Initially, simple raycasting functioned during graybox testing, but once player models and proper rigging were added, that needed to be adjusted, the origin point and target for the raycasting being displaced to ensure rays were drawn head height of units to the enemy's center. A second issue arose once things were adjusted and an additional player model element was placed over the actual GameObject that contained the player scripts, needin a transition to RaycastAll sorted by distance to adjust things, before final changes were made in order to ignore units of the same team for usability purposes.
