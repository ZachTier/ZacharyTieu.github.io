What it is:\
A turn-based tactical role-playing game with an emphasis on using dialogue and empathy to resolve challenges instead of direct combat. Currently wrapping up post-prouction: the meat of the game is in place, fully developed and properly polished, with just a few tweaks needed before the grand release in July of 2025! The game also won the 2025 USC Games Expo Audience Choice Award for Experimental Design.

My responsibilities:\
*Spearheaded the design and implementation of 10+ unique enemy types, collaborating closely with the design team to ensure each AI’s behavior cycle and ability set was both technically feasible and balanced for gameplay. Took point on adapting enemy AI to work without traditional navigation or character systems, coordinating with fellow engineers to develop custom solutions. Faced with the absence of a standard SRPG grid or built-in navigation tools, I architected a hybrid pathfinding system that combined navmesh traversal, raycasting, and tactical heuristics—leveraging enemy/ally positioning and terrain analysis to inform movement and attack decisions. This system enabled dynamic, context-aware AI behavior that supported our game’s strategic depth while working within the constraints of our custom engine.

*Designed and implemented a wide range of enemy abilities, including area-of-effect attacks, buffs, debuffs, and movement-based skills, each tailored to specific enemy archetypes and combat roles. Worked cross-functionally with the design team to translate high-level ability concepts into responsive, in-game mechanics that felt fair, engaging, and strategically meaningful. and itereated on a modular, extensible ability framework that supported status effect stacking, conditional triggers, and spatial targeting logic—all integrated with our custom combat and AI systems to make the abilities functional and readable within our game's framework.

*Worked closely with designers to shape combat encounters by providing technical guidance on enemy behavior, positioning, and ability synergy. Ensured that enemy group compositions and placements complemented their AI roles and ability kits, creating encounters that felt intentional, challenging, and varied. Advised on the feasibility of complex ability interactions, helping refine designs to fit within engine limitations while maintaining gameplay impact. This included analyzing how enemies' spatial behavior—such as flanking, chokepoint denial, or zone control—interacted with abilities like AOE attacks, movement skills, buffs, and debuffs.
