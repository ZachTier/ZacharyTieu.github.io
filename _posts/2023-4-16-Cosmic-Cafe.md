What it is:\
A short overcooked inspired game for the USC 2023 MEGA Game Jam, working under the theme of Cosmic. Having unfortunately passed from the mortal coil, you're stuck in a fate worse than death: customer service, and your dark god of a customer is looking mighty hangry. Smash together stars, moons, and nebulae to cook up some truly cosmic treats before they turn their gaze towards more readily available foodstuffs...

My Responsibilities:
* Pitched and led the creative vision for Cosmic Cafe, a chaotic Overcooked-style kitchen sim with a Lovecraftian twist, blending fast-paced co-op gameplay with surreal cosmic horror themes. Established the game’s core mechanics and narrative direction, driving initial ideation into a fully playable prototype within the constraints of the jam.
* Designed and implemented key systems in Unity with C#, including player movement, interactive stations, cooking logic, and task sequencing, ensuring fluid and responsive gameplay. Built the foundational simulation loop, balancing emergent chaos with clarity and fun to deliver a polished, playable experience on a short timeline.
* Defined the game's thematic identity and tone, guiding art direction to reflect a stylized mix of kitchen absurdity and otherworldly horror. Wrote supporting narrative elements—including UI flavor text, environment prompts, and world lore—to expand the game's sense of place and deepen the cosmic theme.
