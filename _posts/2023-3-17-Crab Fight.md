What it is:\
A competitive tabletop strategy game, focused around mitigating risk and RNG, positioning your units, and asserting board control on a constantly shrinking map. Take control of your crabs and duke it out for the crustacean crown in the tide pool!

My Responsibilities:
* Led the design of a fast-paced, competitive board game centered on player interaction, strategic chaos, and crab-themed combat, blending tactical depth with lighthearted, humorous gameplay. Developed the game's core mechanics, emphasizing clever counterplay, timing, and player-driven escalation.
* Conducted extensive balance and playtesting across multiple iterations, using both observation and structured feedback to refine game pacing, increase player agency, and ensure each match remained dynamic and fair. Adjusted abilities, card effects, and turn structure to promote replayability and strategic variety.
* Managed clear, accessible documentation of rules, mechanics, and design rationale for both teammates and playtesters. Delivered polished presentations and refined rulebooks that made the game easy to learn, fun to teach, and rewarding to master.
