What it is:\
A hotseat style party game. In today's world, engagement is everything, so make the best of that and be the king/queen of farmed likes! Scope out the crowd, find the best hot takes to give, and satisfy sponsors to win points and become the next big trendsetter.

What I did:
* Led the game's playtesting strategy and execution, organizing structured sessions across diverse player groups to gather actionable insights on clarity, balance, and engagement. Synthesized qualitative and quantitative feedback into clear design recommendations, directly informing changes that improved game flow, readability, and player retention.
* Collaborated closely with the design and engineering teams to support rapid prototyping and agile iteration, ensuring that playtest findings translated quickly into meaningful gameplay adjustments. Maintained strong cross-discipline communication and team cohesion, helping keep development focused, flexible, and player-driven.

What I learnt:\
Developing games in larger teams with a larger timeframe is a very different scale compared to tackling challenges in smaller teams. Communication is always key, but co-ordinating to avoid blockers, keeping track of where you stand in the development pipeline, and knowing where to find things and how to communicate problems and solutions are skills that can't be practiced without these big team projects.
