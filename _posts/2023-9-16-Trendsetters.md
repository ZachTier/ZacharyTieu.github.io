What it is:\
A hotseat style party game. In today's world, engagement is everything, so make the best of that and be the king/queen of farmed likes! Scope out the crowd, find the best hot takes to give, and satisfy sponsors to win points and become the next big trendsetter.

What I did:
* Led the game's playtesting strategy and execution, organizing structured sessions across diverse player groups to gather actionable insights on clarity, balance, and engagement. Synthesized qualitative and quantitative feedback into clear design recommendations, directly informing changes that improved game flow, readability, and player retention.
* Played a central role in the teamâ€™s rapid prototyping and agile design workflow, helping maintain momentum through frequent rule refinements, content testing, and mechanic iteration. Fostered strong team collaboration by keeping feedback cycles tight, communication clear, and player experience at the core of every design decision.
* Also contributed heavily to iterating on the game's player instructions and onboarding materials, improving usability, clarity, and visual structure to reduce confusion during first-time play. This involved rewriting unclear language, reorganizing rule flow, and incorporating player feedback to ensure the rulebook supported quick understanding and smooth gameplay.
